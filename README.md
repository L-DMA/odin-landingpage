# Odin Project: Landing Page

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a landing page based on provided design images. The main goal is to replicate the design as closely as possible using HTML and CSS.

### Typography

- **Font:** Roboto

### Project Instructions

1. **Hero Text:** This is the statement that appears at the top of the web page.
2. **Sections:** The website consists of four main sections and a footer. It's recommended to tackle one section at a time, starting from the top.
3. **Content First:** For each section, start by adding all the content to the page using HTML. Once the content is in place, move on to styling with CSS.
4. **Single Stylesheet:** Use a single CSS file for styling the entire project.
5. **Flexbox Refresher:** Many elements on the page are similar to those in the flexbox exercises. Refer back to those exercises if needed.
6. **No Mobile Styling:** Focus on the desktop layout for this project. Mobile responsiveness will be covered later.
